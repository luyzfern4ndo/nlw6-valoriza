## :clipboard: Requirements

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) installed. You will need programs like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) (or anything like that) to get access to the application's routes.
